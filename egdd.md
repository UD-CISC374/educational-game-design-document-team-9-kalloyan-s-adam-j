# Long Drive

## Elevator Pitch

Players will be challenged through addictive gameplay to drive their car as far as they can without breaking it down. Other similar games focus mainly on the player's reflexes, but we believe that by incorporating educational problems, the player will have a more meaningful experience.

## Influences (Brief)

- Subway Surfer:
  - Medium: Game
  - Explanation: This game is an influence because it is quite addictive running through a trainyard with the intention of getting a high score. As your character runs, the pace of the game increases making it more challenging and likely that the player will run into an obstacle and get caught by the guard.
- Guitar Hero:
  - Medium: Game
  - Explanation: This game is an influence because the objective of the game is to select the correct notes; otherwise, the player's score will suffer. Long Drive would work somewhat similar, except instead of notes the player would have to drive through the correct answer to the question given at that moment.
- Temple Run
  - Medium: game
  - Explanation: Temple Run is an influence because in this game players progress through a course with various obstacles that the player must maneuver around. In our game, our players would progress through the course however the obstacles will be math problems. Players can choose which problem they want to do, and if they can not complete the problem in the given time, then their vehicle will break down similar to a collision in Temple Run. 

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

- Use the arrow keys to move the car
- The more miles(score) the player drives, the faster the problems will appear
- When the player runs into an answer that is incorrect, a wreck occurs
- 3 wrecks and the game is over
- The player has no control of the speed of the car
- The types of problems will depend on the chosen difficulty
- Easy difficulty will include addition and subtraction
- Medium difficulty will add multiplication
- Hard difficulty will add multiplication and division

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

## Target Audiences

- K-5 audience
 - this can work because of the different difficulties that the game offers.

## Target Contexts

- The game will be used to complement the teacher’s material. It could be used in class when the students have a base understanding of the different topics.
- The teacher could assign it for homework by having the students reach a specific score for the night.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the lesson, the player will be able to correctly solve at least 90% of the basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division problems that they are given.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

The player, at the least, will need to have some experience with addition and subtraction. As the difficulty increases however, skills in both multiplication and division will also be needed. 

## Assessment Measures

The learning will be accessed by the player’s score. The score will be directly related to how far the car gets. The distance the car travels is dependent on the players ability to quickly and correctly solve the problem presented. 

# What sets this project apart?

- Kids love driving games with some form of a score.
- Kids love to progress through a game by unlocking new items (in this case, cars).
- Kids will strengthen their knowledge of what was taught in class.
- Kids will be motivated to get the correct answers because it will be the only way to get currency for new items.

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

This will be a one player game. The player select options using the mouse and change the direction of their car using the keyboard.

## Player Modes

- Main Menu: This is where the player selects their difficulty and starts their game.
- Store Menu: This is where the player will be able to buy new vehicles to use in game.
- Game: This is where the player actually drives the car for as long as they can without wrecking it.
- Game Over Menu: This is the menu that shows when the player wrecks his or her car, and the player will be able to either play again or go back to the main menu.  

# Gameplay Objectives

- Solidify learned knowledge:
    - Description: Get the right answers by driving through the correct option in order to practice learned material.
    - Alignment: This aligns with the learning objective because students will actively practice what they were taught in class.
- High Score:
    - Description: Increase your score by driving for as long as possible without wrecking the car.
    - Alignment: This aligns with the learning objective because it would motivate players to practice what they have been taught in real life in order to be better at the game.
- Unlockables:
    - Description: Unlock new items in the store by getting currency. Currency will be earned for every correct answer the player drives through.
    - Alignment: This aligns with the learning objective because it would motivate players to play the game more, knowing that there is an incentive of unlocking new vehicles.

# Procedures/Actions

The user can press the left and right arrow button to move the car. They can also pause with the escape button.

# Rules

- If the player drives into the wrong answer that counts as a hit.
- Three hits means the player has wrecked the car and the game is over.
- If the player drives through the correct answer, they will earn currency to use in the store.
- Problems will be randomly generated.

# Objects/Entities

- The given problem
- The answer options
- Buttons for the menus
- Layout of the menus
- The car
- The road
- Other cars/objects on the road to avoid


## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)

- Driving: Use the right and left arrow keys to drive the car. The background will be moving, making it seem like the car is going forward.
- Score: Score will be dependent on how long the player can drive the car without wrecking it.
- Acquiring Currency: The player will acquire currency everytime they drive through a correct answer.
- Spending currency: Currency can be used to buy new vehicles in the store.
- Game Over: When the player hits an obstacle(incorrect answer) 3 times the game will be over. A popup will appear notifying the player of their score and total acquired currency. They will have the option of restarting the game or going to the main menu.
- Problems/Answers: The problems will be generated randomly. The chosen difficulty will determine the types of problems. One of the answers will be correct and the others will not, but they will be relatively believable. 
- Pace of the game: The game will start off slow. Approximately 15 - 20 seconds between problems. However, as the player continuously answers the questions, the pace will increase to the point where the player will need to be sharp and fully concentrated in order to avoid wrecking the car.
- Difficulty: There will be 3 settings - easy, medium, and hard. Easy will only include addition and subtraction problems. Medium will include addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Hard will be like medium, but it will also add division problems.
- Tutorial: There will be an option on the main menu to run through a tutorial. The tutorial will inform the player how to play.

    
## Feedback

- If the player drives through the correct answer, the number will highlight green. 
- If the player drives through the wrong answer, the number will highlight red.
- The score will act as a long term indicator of the player’s improvement. As the player gets better with the arithmetic, their score will progressively increase.

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

There will be a tutorial for the players to go through. It will show them which buttons to press to drive the car and point to objects of focus like the score, currency, and problems/answers.

## Presentation of Content

The player will learn through repetition. By seeing similar problems over and over again, the player will naturally develop a better feel for the arithmetic and value of the numbers.

## Story (Brief)

Players use the arrow keys to maneuver their vehicle into the correct answer to the problem presented at the top of the screen. The player also must avoid the cones and other obstacles along the track. If the player collides with the incorrect answer, the car suffers a hit (one flat tire). There are 3 lives until the car can no longer drive and the game is over.  

## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*


# Assets Needed

## Aesthetics

The game will be similar in aesthetics to subway surfer. We want it to be visually appealing with colors that are not too harsh (i.e a black and white game with red numbers). In terms of gameplay it will be most similar to ‘Cars’ which is another top down 2d driving game in which the player avoids the obstacles on the road for as long as possible.
